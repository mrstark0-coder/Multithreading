#Python Multithreading and ThreadPoolExecutor Demo

This Python script demonstrates two ways to perform concurrent tasks using:

threading.Thread (manual threading)
concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor (thread pool)

It simulates tasks that take a few seconds to complete (using time.sleep) and shows how concurrency can help improve performance for I/O-bound tasks.
